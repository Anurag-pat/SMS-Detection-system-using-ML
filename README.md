üîçOverview

The SMS Spam Detection System is a machine learning-based solution designed to automatically classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam). This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms to build an accurate and efficient model that helps users filter out unwanted spam messages.

üöÄFeature

‚û°Ô∏è Preprocessing of raw SMS text (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, etc.)

‚û°Ô∏è Vectorization using techniques like TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

‚û°Ô∏è Model training using popular algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or Logistic Regression)

‚û°Ô∏è Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

‚û°Ô∏è Easy-to-use interface for prediction (CLI or optional web app)
